    PYNUCDET : PYNUCastro Detonation Estimator Tool.  A simple open source code to calculate the nuclear self-heating of a stellar fluid element, employing pynucastro for nuclear network and isotope properties, and including the effects of electron degeneracy and Coulomb interactions with the Helmholtz EOS. Estimates of the detonation length scales are also computed.
