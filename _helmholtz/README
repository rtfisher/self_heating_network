a simple compile and link should work.

gfortran -o helmholtz.exe  helmholtz_wrapper.f90 helmholtz_library.F90 main.F90

This hacked-up version of Frank Timmes' Helmholtz EOS takes in density, temperature (in CGS), as well as Zbar and Abar, and returns the EOS quantities separated by spaces --     pres, eint, gammac, gammae, h, cs, cp, cv (all CGS). These values can be parsed by standard Unix techniques.
